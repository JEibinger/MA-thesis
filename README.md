# Repository to accompany the thesis "Positionsanalyse frühneuhochdeutscher Grapheme - Möglichkeiten der hyperdiplomatischen Transkription in der Digitalen Paläographie"

The focus of the Master's thesis are the development and evaluation of a data analysis workflow based on hyperdiplomatic transcriptions of the digital edition project CoReMA - 'Cooking Recipes of the Middle Ages'. The aim was to implement a case study to test the analytical potential of a data basis rooted in the hyperdiplomatic transcription model. The positional distribution of graphemes within word boundaries in selected transcriptions of cooking recipe texts from the project was examined to demonstrate how the method could be applied to this as well as similar research questions. In selecting the objects of study, attention was paid primarily to the chronological dating of the manuscripts as well as to their length in order to be able to identify representative trends in the grapheme distribution. The thesis itself first presents the theoretical background, covering topics in the fields of German studies, palaeography and digital humanities. The development of these theoretical basics serves as a necessary preparation for the presentation of the analysis workflow, which is then explained step by step. The central aspects of data preparation, analysis and visualisation are all explained in detail.

The files in this repository are sorted according to their functions and the three different steps in the process: Data preparation, analysis and visualisation. 
1. How to get from CoReMA's TEI-XML to the CSV used in the analysis (Data prep) - https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/demo/cab/file and XSLT's
2. How to analyse the CSV and get data for visualisation - every analysed manuscript with all XMl, CSV files and Jupyter Notebooks
3. How to visualise the data - all HTML and JavaScript files

All files contain commentary on how to use them.
